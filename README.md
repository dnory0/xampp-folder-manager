# xampp-folder-manager
## description:
An electron app to manage replacement of multiple website projects on the htdocs folder of xampp app

## requirements:
   - installation directory of the xampp (xampp must be installed or any server app that uses htdocs as the website launch directory.)
   - the replacement directory which is used to manage the other projects.

## how it works:
the app uses the replacement directory to get projects (**subdirectories**), so you can place them on htdocs directory and copy htdocs
directory content to a subdirectory inside the replacement directory, so you can manage what's inside the htdocs directory.
